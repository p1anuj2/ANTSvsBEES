# ANTSvsBEES
This project implements binary image classification (bees vs. ants) using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The model is fine-tuned on the Hymenoptera dataset, which consists of two classes: bees and ants.  
The implementation includes ViT-Base (16x16 patches, 224x224 images) pretrained on ImageNet and is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy on this dataset. 

The project includes: 

1 Data preprocessing & augmentation. 

2 Fine-tuning a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT).

3 Model training with learning rate scheduling.

4 Performance evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, and loss plots).

5 Visualizing sample predictions.
